NovaCore ERP - Premium Demo UI (No Dependencies)

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Everything is static and works without any build or install steps.

What you get
- Premium dark UI with sidebar, topbar, cards, tables, modals
- Clickable navigation and buttons with demo modals/toasts
- Pages: Dashboard, Inventory, Purchase, Sales, Pricing & Billing, Finance, Reports, Users, Settings
- Mock data prewired for KPIs, inventory, orders, invoices

Files
- `index.html` – app shell and layout
- `assets/css/styles.css` – theme and components
- `assets/js/app.js` – router, mock data, interactions

Notes
- This is a UI-first scaffold for stakeholder demos. No backend required.
- Later we can replace mock data with APIs and add authentication.
